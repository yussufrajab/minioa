# Employee Management API Testing Report

## ✅ Test Results Summary

**Date**: July 16, 2025  
**Status**: ALL TESTS PASSED  
**Total Endpoints Tested**: 11  
**Authentication**: JWT Bearer Token ✅  
**Database**: PostgreSQL with sample data ✅  

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. Authentication System
- **Issue**: Audit log username field constraint violation
- **Fix**: Updated AuditService to accept and store username parameter
- **Impact**: All authentication and audit logging now working properly

### 2. Version Field Issue
- **Issue**: JPA @Version field was NULL causing update/delete operations to fail
- **Error**: `Cannot invoke "java.lang.Long.longValue()" because "current" is null`
- **Fix**: Updated all entities with NULL version fields to 0
- **Command**: `UPDATE employees SET version = 0 WHERE version IS NULL;`

## 📋 Endpoint Testing Results

### 1. Authentication Endpoints
- ✅ `POST /api/auth/login` - User authentication with JWT token generation

### 2. Employee CRUD Operations
- ✅ `GET /api/employees` - List all employees (paginated)
- ✅ `GET /api/employees/{id}` - Get employee by ID
- ✅ `POST /api/employees` - Create new employee (with audit logging)
- ✅ `PUT /api/employees/{id}` - Update employee (with audit logging)
- ✅ `DELETE /api/employees/{id}` - Soft delete employee (with audit logging)

### 3. Employee Search & Filter Operations
- ✅ `GET /api/employees/payroll/{payrollNumber}` - Find by payroll number
- ✅ `GET /api/employees/zanzibar-id/{zanzibarId}` - Find by Zanzibar ID
- ✅ `GET /api/employees/search?searchTerm={term}` - Search employees
- ✅ `GET /api/employees/institution/{institutionId}` - Filter by institution
- ✅ `GET /api/employees/status/{status}` - Filter by employment status

### 4. Employee Status Management
- ✅ `PATCH /api/employees/{id}/status?status={status}` - Update employment status

## 🔐 Security Testing

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- ✅ Admin user can access all endpoints
- ✅ JWT token validation working correctly
- ✅ Unauthorized requests properly rejected

### Authentication Flow
1. ✅ User login with username/password
2. ✅ JWT token generation and return
3. ✅ Token validation for protected endpoints
4. ✅ User context injection (@CurrentUser annotation)

## 📊 Database Operations

### Data Validation
- ✅ Employee creation with all required fields
- ✅ Unique constraints enforced (payroll, zanzibar_id, zssf_number)
- ✅ Foreign key relationships working (institution_id)
- ✅ Soft delete implementation (is_active = false)

### Audit Trail
- ✅ All CRUD operations logged in audit_logs table
- ✅ Username and user_id properly tracked
- ✅ Before/after values captured for updates
- ✅ Success/failure status recorded

## 🧪 Sample Test Data

### Test Employee Created
```json
{
  "fullName": "John Doe",
  "dateOfBirth": "1995-01-01",
  "payrollNumber": "PAY999",

  "zssfNumber": "ZSSF999",
  "institutionId": "inst-001",
  "employmentStatus": "CONFIRMED",
  "employmentDate": "2025-01-01"
}
```

### Test Employee Updated

{
  "id": "emp-001",
  "fullName": "Ali Juma Ali (Updated)",
  "rank": "Senior Officer",
  "phoneNumber": "+255777123456"
}
```

### Test Employee Deleted

# Auth Fix Summary

## Issue
The user object was coming back as undefined after login because the backend response structure was nested differently than expected.

## Root Cause
The backend returns:
```
{
  success: true,
  message: "Login successful",
  data: {
    token: "...",
    refreshToken: "...",
    tokenType: "Bearer",
    expiresIn: 600000,
    user: {
      id: "...",
      username: "...",
      fullName: "...",
      role: "ADMIN",  // This is an enum value
      isEnabled: true,
      // ... other fields
    }
  }
}
```

But the auth store was expecting the user data at a different nesting level.

## Solution
1. Fixed the response parsing to correctly extract the auth data from `response.data.data`
2. Added validation to ensure user data exists before trying to use it
3. Updated field mapping to handle backend field names (e.g., `isEnabled` instead of `enabled`, `fullName` instead of `name`)

## Changes Made
- Updated auth store login method to properly parse nested response structure
- Added validation for required user fields (id, username, role)
- Fixed field mapping for backend UserDto properties

The login should now work correctly and the user role should be properly set.
